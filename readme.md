//Playwright with Jest Automation for Mercury Tours website

* This playwright automation framework is written in javascript with Jest as a test runner. It runs in chrome

* It contains page object model pattern, generates jest HTML report, takes screenshot and log4js logs

* User can launch http://demo.guru99.com/test/newtours/
* User can sign in to mercury tours website and land on home page
* User can click on flights, select no of passengers and trip type
* User can check the no of seats available

* Note - I have written the script to add folder and files to it. But did not get a chance to upload files to web application, reason is could not find any such sample web application


Steps to Run the Automation scripts
1. git clone https://github.com/sshankaregowda/mercury_page_tests.git
2. Navigate to project root directory
3. npm install
4. npm run test
